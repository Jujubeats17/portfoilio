<h2> Obamacon <h2>
<p> when I first started the obamacon project, I didn't know where or how to start coding for the required filter. Luckily my partner was able to figure out the code for the first part. After that, we made the black and white filter together.
What I was most proud of for the obamacon was that I was able to make a sepia filter.  </p>

<h3> Circuits <h3>
  <p> I learned how to create a circuit through a breadboard. The circuit featured resisters, wires, and a LED light; the objective was to have the LED lightbulb to light up.
